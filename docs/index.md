Styolmetry is a friend of text analysis, security, forensics, may also be applied to coding, music and art
In nutshell this is text analysis with goal

## Burrows Delta
- calculates the probability that two books were by the same author
- a statistic which expresses the distance between two authors’ writing styles
-  is designed to compare an anonymous text (or set of texts) to many different authors’ signatures at the same time
-  measures how the anonymous text and sets of texts written by an arbitrary number of known authors all diverge from the average of all of them put together
-  gives equal weight to every feature that it measures

## Burrows method 
- the first 50–100 most common words had proven to be good candidates because they seemed to distinguish reliably between authors
- describes the distance between one text and a group of text
- uses the Manhattan distance
